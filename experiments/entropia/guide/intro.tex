\textit{Entropia} is an open-source command-line tool that implements a family of conformance checking measures. This guide is intended to explains through a series of simple steps how to use the \textit{Entropia} tool to measure precision and recall between a model and an event log using classical non-deterministic and stochastic conformance checking approaches. This guide covers the following topics:

\begin{enumerate}
\itemsep0em 
\item Getting Started: find out how to get \textit{Entropia} and prerequisites required to run the tool.  
\item Classical Non-deterministic Conformance Checking Measures: The \textit{Entropia} commands for the are provided where each command-line instruction is illustrated with an example, making it easy to find the information you are looking for. The section covers the following measures: 
\begin{enumerate}
\itemsep0em 
\item[1.] Exact Matching Precision and Recall \cite{Polyvyanyy2020TOSEM}, 
\item[2.] Partial Matching Precision and Recall \cite{PolyvyanyyK2019}; and
\item[3.] Controlled Partial Matching Precision and Recall \cite{KalenkovaP2020},
\end{enumerate}
\item The \textit{Entropia} commands for stochastic conformance checking measures. Here, you can find out a detailed description you need to apply different stochastic conformance checking approaches. The section includes the following measures: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[1.] Stochastic Precision and Recall  \cite{Leemans2020}; and
\item[2.] Entropic Relevance \cite{abs-2007-09310}.
